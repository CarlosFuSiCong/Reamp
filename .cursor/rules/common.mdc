# Common Development Rules

## 1. Git Workflow
- Before writing any code, **sync with the latest `dev/main` branch**.
- **Create a new branch for the current task** from the latest base.
- Branch naming: `<type>/<scope>-<short-desc>`  
  - e.g. `feat/auth-login`, `fix/workflow-crash`
- All work for that task must be completed inside the new feature branch.
- Do not commit directly to `dev/main`.
- Do not reuse branches for multiple tasks.
- **Before backend development**, check whether the project uses Docker:
  - If Docker / Docker Compose files exist, follow them as the default setup.
  - If no Docker setup exists, **confirm the local runtime and environment assumptions before proceeding**.

## 2. Commit Rules (Atomic Commits)
- Each commit performs **one clear, small, focused change**.
- Do not mix unrelated changes.
- A single commit **may include implementation + corresponding tests / typings**.
- **Do NOT** include global formatting, mass renaming, or unrelated refactors in the same commit.
- Use **Conventional Commit prefixes**, one-line only:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `refactor:` for internal code improvements (no behavior change)
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `chore:` for tools, config, formatting, build scripts
- Commit messages must be **simple, short English sentences**.
- A commit message should clearly explain **what changed** and **why**, without reading the code.

## 3. Comments & Code Style
- Prefer **self-explanatory code** over long comments.
- Only add comments for **non-obvious logic or caveats**.
- Use **simple one-line English comments** when necessary.
- Avoid long descriptive block comments.
- Do not use comments to explain what the code does — the code should explain itself.

## 4. General Development Principles
- Write code that is easy to read, modify, and debug.
- Prefer explicit, readable logic over clever or compact implementations.
- Keep concerns separated (UI vs logic, mapping vs validation, etc.).
- Follow project formatting rules (Prettier, dotnet format, editorconfig).

## 5. Documentation (Important)
- **Do NOT generate full Markdown documents unless explicitly requested.**
- For documentation tasks, **update only the necessary sections or paragraphs**.
- Avoid over-documentation; documentation should serve a clear purpose.
- If a long document is required, **ask for confirmation first**.

## 6. Task Summary (Required)
- After completing a task or PR, **summarize what was done in 2–3 short sentences**:
  - What was changed
  - Why it was changed
  - Any notable impact or risk (if applicable)
