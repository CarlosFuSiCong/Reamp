# Common Development Rules

## 1. Git Workflow
- Before writing any code, **create a new branch for the current task**.
- All work for that task must be completed inside the new feature branch.

## 2. Commit Rules (Atomic Commits)
- Each commit performs **one clear, small, focused change**.
- Do not mix unrelated changes (e.g., feature + refactor + fix in one commit).
- Use **simple, short English commit messages**, one line only.

## 3. Comments & Code Style
- Prefer **self-explanatory code** over long comments.
- Only add comments for **non-obvious logic / caveats**.
- Use **simple one-line English comments** when necessary.
- Avoid long descriptive block comments.

## 4. General Development Principles
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code.
- Keep concerns separated (UI vs logic, mapping vs validation, etc.).
- Follow project formatting rules (Prettier, dotnet format, editorconfig).
