# Common Development Rules

## 1. Git Workflow
- Before writing any code, **create a new branch for the current task**.
- All work for that task must be completed inside the new feature branch.

## 2. Commit Rules (Atomic Commits)
- Each commit performs **one clear, small, focused change**.
- Do not mix unrelated changes.
- Use **Conventional Commit prefixes**, one-line only:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `refactor:` for internal code improvements (no behavior change)
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `chore:` for tools, config, formatting, build scripts
- Commit messages must be **simple, short English sentences**.

## 3. Comments & Code Style
- Prefer **self-explanatory code** over long comments.
- Only add comments for **non-obvious logic or caveats**.
- Use **simple one-line English comments** when necessary.
- Avoid long descriptive block comments.

## 4. General Development Principles
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code.
- Keep concerns separated (UI vs logic, mapping vs validation, etc.).
- Follow project formatting rules (Prettier, dotnet format, editorconfig).

## 5. Documentation (Important)
- **Do NOT generate full Markdown documents unless I explicitly request it.**
- If a task might require a document, **summarize in a few sentences instead**.
- If generating a long document is necessary, **ask me for confirmation first**.

## 6. Task Summary (Required)
- After completing a task, **summarize what was done in 2–3 short sentences**.
- Focus on *what changed* and *why*, not on implementation details.
