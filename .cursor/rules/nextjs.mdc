# Next.js Frontend Rules

Follow these rules when generating or modifying frontend code.

## 1. Reusable Components
- Extract reusable UI patterns into **independent components or hooks**.
- Avoid duplication; prefer shared utilities.

## 2. File Naming & Style
- Use **kebab-case** for file names.
- Follow Prettier formatting strictly (project config in `.prettierrc`).

## 3. State & Data Management
- Use **TanStack Query** for all server data.
- Always handle loading, success, and error states.
- Keep shared config, enums, labels, and logic centralized.

## 4. Forms & Validation
- Use **React Hook Form + Zod**.
- Each form must have a Zod schema.
- Validation errors must display clearly in the UI.

## 5. UI & Styling
- Use **shadcn/ui** as the primary component library.
- Keep Tailwind usage minimal, consistent, and readable.

## 6. Error Handling & UX Feedback
- Use toast notifications for errors and successes.
- Provide clean loading and empty states.

## 7. Clarity & Maintainability
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever one-liners.
- Separate concerns: hooks for data, components for UI, schemas for validation.
