fix(security): resolve P1 Hangfire exposure and P2 deduplication filtering issues

Fixed two security/reliability issues identified by AI code review:

1. P1 Badge - Hangfire Dashboard Exposure
   Problem:
   - Hangfire dashboard was accessible at /hangfire in ALL environments
   - No authentication/authorization required
   - Exposed job controls, queue management, and operational data to public in production
   - Comment said "no auth for development" but middleware ran unconditionally

   Fix:
   - Wrapped UseHangfireDashboard in app.Environment.IsDevelopment() check
   - Dashboard now ONLY available in Development environment
   - Added comment suggesting IDashboardAuthorizationFilter for Production scenarios
   - Prevents unauthorized access to background job controls in production

   Before:
   app.UseHangfireDashboard("/hangfire"); // ❌ Always exposed

   After:
   if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {
       app.UseHangfireDashboard("/hangfire"); // ✅ Dev-only
   }

2. P2 Badge - Deduplication Query Not Scoped to Studio
   Problem:
   - FindByChecksumAsync queried ALL studios' assets by checksum
   - Returned first match regardless of owner
   - If Studio A and Studio B both had file with SHA256 "abc123":
     * Query might return Studio B's asset first
     * OwnerStudioId check in Application layer would fail
     * Studio A would create duplicate even though it already had the file
   - Broke deduplication reliability when cross-studio duplicates existed

   Fix:
   - Added studioId parameter to IMediaAssetRepository.FindByChecksumAsync
   - Updated repository to filter WHERE checksum = @checksum AND studioId = @studioId
   - Updated Application Service to pass dto.OwnerStudioId to repository
   - Removed redundant OwnerStudioId check in Application layer (now done in query)
   - Ensures deduplication works correctly even with cross-studio identical files

   Before (Repository):
   FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.ChecksumSha256 == checksum) // ❌ Returns any studio's asset

   After (Repository):
   FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.ChecksumSha256 == checksum && m.OwnerStudioId == studioId) // ✅ Scoped to studio

Impact:
- Hangfire: Protects production deployment from unauthorized job management access
- Deduplication: Fixes false-negative deduplication when identical files exist across studios
- Security: Maintains defense-in-depth for multi-tenant isolation

Files Changed:
- Program.cs: Added environment check for Hangfire Dashboard
- IMediaAssetRepository.cs: Added studioId parameter to FindByChecksumAsync
- MediaAssetRepository.cs: Updated query to include studioId filter
- MediaAssetAppService.cs: Pass studioId to repository, removed redundant check
